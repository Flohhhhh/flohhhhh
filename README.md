I'm a frontend developer with a background in graphic design. I also enjoy working on video games in Unreal Engine as a VFX Artist and Tech Artist, or in Creative Direction roles.

## What I'm working on
Right now I'm working on developing my frontend development portfolio and resume to break into a programming career! Some projects I'm working on now include web tools and resources for the FiveM development community.

### Current Projects
- [**Siren Tool**](https://www.dwnstr.com/sirentool/) - I created Siren Tool in 2020, it's my most successful project! It's a development tool for GTA and FiveM developers to use when creating emergency vehicles. It was made with Unreal Engine.
- [**ULC Config Generator V2**](https://github.com/dwnstr/ulc-app) - The ULC Config Generator is a tool to great the configuration files for my [Ultimate Lighting Controller](https://github.com/Flohhhhh/ultimate-lighting-controller) script using a web based GUI!
